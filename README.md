### [Match a Literal String with Different Possibilities](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/regular-expressions/match-a-literal-string-with-different-possibilities)

## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
Suppose you want to match many different words with your regular expression; using the `|` symbol, that becomes possible.  In this challenge, you are using that symbol to identify four different pets hidden within strings!

## HINTS
Inside the string literal, place the pet names, each separated by the `|` symbol.
